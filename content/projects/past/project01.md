The project is mapping and monitoring small-area disturbance features such as well sites and seismic lines using freely available or cost-effective earth observation data. A novel methodology was developed based on the combination of pixel-based image enhancement and object-based image analysis to detect and extract well sites from freely available landsat-4 imagery.
