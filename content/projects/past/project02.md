The Torngat Caribou has always been important to the Inuit regionally in Quebec and Labrador both for food and as part of their culture. In recent years there has been some concerns expressed by Inuit in the decline of the Torngat Caribou herd. Using remote sensing technologies allows monitoring of the herd, its habitat, and the factors that are impacting its survival. In this project, a land cover classification framework was developed using 21 scenes of SPOT- 4&5 imagery of 2007-2010 to classify the Torngat habitat area.
