As part of the MSc. thesis, a preprocessing algorithm based on statistical feature extraction and low pass filtering was developed to reduce the dimensionality of hyperspectral data resulting in an improved accuracy of classification. The results were published in the World Applied Science Journal and two conference proceedings.
