As part of the PhD thesis, the project originally defined as a major part of an NSERC Strategic Grant project, entitled "Development a high fidelity Geographic Information System/ Remote Sensing (GIS/RS) system for detecting urban sprawl, land use information and land cover change." Bahram was the lead in this multidisciplinary project between, departments of Geomatics Engineering, Civil Engineering at University of New Brunswick, and the City of Fredericton. Several peer-reviewed journal papers and conference- proceedings were resulted from this research.
