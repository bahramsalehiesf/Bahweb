This research-based projects investigate on reconstruction of digital elevation models (DEM) generated by stereo UAV imagery digital surface model (DSM). Following the reconstruction of DSM, forest tree height will be estimated based on the combination of object-based image analysis techniques and the DEM/DSM.
