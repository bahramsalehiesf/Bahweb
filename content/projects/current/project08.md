An object-based image analysis frame work is being developed for automatic mapping of forest areas using very high resolution optical aerial images. The method will be used for automatic and fast classification of aerial photographs for delineating small water bodies and forest types. In the second phase the method is able to extract the forest canopy height using DSM generated from the stereo aerial photographs.
