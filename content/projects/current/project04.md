Canada owns approximately 25% of the world's total wetlands. Newfoundland and
Labrador is one of the most wetland-rich provinces in Canada. However, wetland
have not been mapped in NL so far. This project combines historical aerial high
resolution ortho photos and new polarimetric Radar data to develop a fast and
effective mapping tool for classification of wetland in the province.
