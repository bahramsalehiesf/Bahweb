NL is the only province in Atlantic Canada that does not have a wetland
inventory system. In this project, we are developing a state-of-the-art
framework for wetland classification and inventory system generation utilizing
advanced optical and SAR remote sensing technologies for w. The techniques
being developed will be used later for the province-wide wetland inventory creation.
