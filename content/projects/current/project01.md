One of the three components of a larger project funded by Defense Research and Development Canada (DRDC) through the Defense Innovation Research Program (DIRP), this project aims to develop, implement and demonstrate RCM SAR data for Terrain and permafrost change analysis and modelling in Canada's Northern Territories. A Multi-source (combined optical, AR, InSAR, and Geological data) object-based data analysis is being developed implemented to detect and model the changes in terrain stability and non - continues permafrost regions of Canada's North. The project is being carried out by a multi-disciplinary team of experts including Remote Sensing scientists, Engineers and Geophysicists
