      <description>NL is the only province in Atlantic Canada that does not have a wetland inventory system. In this project, we are developing a state-of-the-art framework for wetland classification and inventory system generation utilizing advanced optical and SAR remote sensing technologies for w. The techniques being developed will be used later for the province-wide wetland inventory creation.</description>

      <description>One of the three components of a larger project funded by Defense Research and Development Canada (DRDC) through the Defense Innovation Research Program (DIRP), this project aims to develop, implement and demonstrate RCM SAR data for Terrain and permafrost change analysis and modelling in Canada&amp;rsquo;s Northern Territories. A Multi-source (combined optical, AR, InSAR, and Geological data) object-based data analysis is being developed implemented to detect and model the changes in terrain stability and non - continues permafrost regions of Canada&amp;rsquo;s North.</description>

      <description>As part of the MSc. thesis, a preprocessing algorithm based on statistical feature extraction and low pass filtering was developed to reduce the dimensionality of hyperspectral data resulting in an improved accuracy of classification. The results were published in the World Applied Science Journal and two conference proceedings.</description>

      <description>An object-based image analysis frame work is being developed for automatic mapping of forest areas using very high resolution optical aerial images. The method will be used for automatic and fast classification of aerial photographs for delineating small water bodies and forest types. In the second phase the method is able to extract the forest canopy height using DSM generated from the stereo aerial photographs.</description>

      <description>Canada owns approximately 25% of the world&amp;rsquo;s total wetlands. Newfoundland and Labrador is one of the most wetland-rich provinces in Canada. However, wetland have not been mapped in NL so far. This project combines historical aerial high resolution ortho photos and new polarimetric Radar data to develop a fast and effective mapping tool for classification of wetland in the province.</description>

      <description>The project is mapping and monitoring small-area disturbance features such as well sites and seismic lines using freely available or cost-effective earth observation data. A novel methodology was developed based on the combination of pixel-based image enhancement and object-based image analysis to detect and extract well sites from freely available landsat-4 imagery.</description>

      <title>Torngat Caribou habitat classification using remote sensing technology</title>
      <link>https://bahramesf.github.io/projects/past/project02/</link>

      <description>The Torngat Caribou has always been important to the Inuit regionally in Quebec and Labrador both for food and as part of their culture. In recent years there has been some concerns expressed by Inuit in the decline of the Torngat Caribou herd. Using remote sensing technologies allows monitoring of the herd, its habitat, and the factors that are impacting its survival. In this project, a land cover classification framework was developed using 21 scenes of SPOT- 4&amp;amp;5 imagery of 2007-2010 to classify the Torngat habitat area.</description>

      <description>This research-based projects investigate on reconstruction of digital elevation models (DEM) generated by stereo UAV imagery digital surface model (DSM). Following the reconstruction of DSM, forest tree height will be estimated based on the combination of object-based image analysis techniques and the DEM/DSM.</description>

      <description>As part of the PhD thesis, the project originally defined as a major part of an NSERC Strategic Grant project, entitled &amp;ldquo;Development a high fidelity Geographic Information System/ Remote Sensing (GIS/RS) system for detecting urban sprawl, land use information and land cover change.&amp;rdquo; Bahram was the lead in this multidisciplinary project between, departments of Geomatics Engineering, Civil Engineering at University of New Brunswick, and the City of Fredericton. Several peer-reviewed journal papers and conference- proceedings were resulted from this research.</description>
