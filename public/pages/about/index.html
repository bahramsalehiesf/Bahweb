<h2 id="biography">Biography</h2>
<p>Received his PhD degree in Geomatics Engineering - Remote Sensing from University of New Brunswick (UNB) in 2012, Dr. Salehi joined C-CORE with LOOKNorth , a Canadian Centre of Excellence for Commercialization and Research, as a Remote sensing scientist/engineer in 2013. He is currently a senior remote sensing engineer with C-CORE and a cross- appointed professor to Faculty of Engineering and Applied Science at Memorial University (MUN). Prior to his current position Dr. Salehi was a NSERC post-doctoral visiting fellow in Canadian Government Laboratories at Earth Observation, Science and Technology Branch of Agriculture and Agri-food Canada in Ottawa.</p>
<p>Dr. Salehi has over 15 years of academic and industrial R&amp;D experience in remote sensing, geomatics, and photogrammetry with specialization in very high resolution optical, polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (SAR), Interferometric SAR (InSAR), and hyperspectral data algorithm and application development. In addition, he has over 6 years of teaching experience at four different universities including MUN and UNB where he taught a number of courses including remote sensing, photogrammetry, geomatics, and surveying to undergraduate and graduate students form a variety of disciplines in Engineering and Science. Bahram&rsquo;s research experience and interests span a range of topics in optical and SAR data processing for environmental mapping and monitoring including wetland classification and SAR-based water level change monitoring, satellite- and Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV)-based terrestrial pipeline oil leakage detection and impact monitoring, InSAR-based permafrost monitoring, urban land cover classification, satellite-based moving vehicle information extraction, accurate crop type classification, oil and gas-related land disturbance monitoring, land cover classification and forest mapping and tree height estimation. While supervising a team of Postdocs, graduate students, and work-term students at MUN and C-CORE, Dr. Salehi is conducting operational research at C-CORE in collaboration with industry, federal, and provincial governments utilizing advanced earth observation technologies for various environmental applications. Together with his team of grad students, Dr Salehi has developed a small software package - Advanced Remote Sensing Lab (ARSeL) - comprising of some advanced algorithms for processing of optical and SAR satellite imagery for environmental monitoring.</p>
<p>Bahram has received a number of awards, scholarships, and grants including the 2017-2019 MITACS Grant, 2015-2019 NSERC Discovery Grant, 2015-2018 Environment Canada Atlantic Ecosystem Initiatives Funding, 2015-2018 Government of Canada, National Conservation Plan, 2014-2017 Newfoundland and Labrador research and development corporation (RDC) Ignite grant, the NSERC visiting fellowship in Canadian government laboratories in 2012, the 2012 ERDAS-DigitalGlobe Geospatial Challenge, and the First paper prize at the UNB graduate students&rsquo; competition in 2011. Dr. Salehi is the author of more than 50 peer-reviewed journal papers, book chapters, and refereed conference papers. He is an Associate editor for the Canadian Journal of Remote Sensing, a guest editor for ISPRS International Journal of Geo-information, a new editorial board member of Journal of Geodesy and Geomatics Engineering and has served as the reviewer for more than 25 grant applications, journals and conference proceedings. He also serves as a director for Canadian Remote Sensing Society, and as an executive member of ISPRS Commission III, WGIII/3.Dr. Salehi is a registered member of professional engineers and geoscientist (P.Eng.) of Newfoundland and Labrador and New Brunswick. He is a member of IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Society, American Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, American Geophysical Union, and Canadian Institute of Geomatics.</p>
