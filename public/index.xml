      <description>NL is the only province in Atlantic Canada that does not have a wetland inventory system. In this project, we are developing a state-of-the-art framework for wetland classification and inventory system generation utilizing advanced optical and SAR remote sensing technologies for w. The techniques being developed will be used later for the province-wide wetland inventory creation.</description>

      <description>One of the three components of a larger project funded by Defense Research and Development Canada (DRDC) through the Defense Innovation Research Program (DIRP), this project aims to develop, implement and demonstrate RCM SAR data for Terrain and permafrost change analysis and modelling in Canada&amp;rsquo;s Northern Territories. A Multi-source (combined optical, AR, InSAR, and Geological data) object-based data analysis is being developed implemented to detect and model the changes in terrain stability and non - continues permafrost regions of Canada&amp;rsquo;s North.</description>

      <description>An object-based image analysis frame work is being developed for automatic mapping of forest areas using very high resolution optical aerial images. The method will be used for automatic and fast classification of aerial photographs for delineating small water bodies and forest types. In the second phase the method is able to extract the forest canopy height using DSM generated from the stereo aerial photographs.</description>

      <description>Canada owns approximately 25% of the world&amp;rsquo;s total wetlands. Newfoundland and Labrador is one of the most wetland-rich provinces in Canada. However, wetland have not been mapped in NL so far. This project combines historical aerial high resolution ortho photos and new polarimetric Radar data to develop a fast and effective mapping tool for classification of wetland in the province.</description>

      <title>Torngat Caribou habitat classification using remote sensing technology</title>
      <link>https://bahramesf.github.io/projects/past/project02/</link>

      <description>The Torngat Caribou has always been important to the Inuit regionally in Quebec and Labrador both for food and as part of their culture. In recent years there has been some concerns expressed by Inuit in the decline of the Torngat Caribou herd. Using remote sensing technologies allows monitoring of the herd, its habitat, and the factors that are impacting its survival. In this project, a land cover classification framework was developed using 21 scenes of SPOT- 4&amp;amp;5 imagery of 2007-2010 to classify the Torngat habitat area.</description>
